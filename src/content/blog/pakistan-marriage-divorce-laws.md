Marriage and divorce laws in Pakistan are governed by Islamic principles, statutory laws, and judicial precedents. These laws regulate the rights and responsibilities of spouses, legal procedures for marriage and divorce, and the protection of women and children in case of dissolution.

## 1. Marriage Laws in Pakistan

### Legal Framework

Marriage in Pakistan is primarily governed by:

- **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961**
- **The Nikah Nama (Marriage Contract)**
- **The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939**
- **The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929**

### Essential Conditions for a Valid Marriage

1. **Free Consent:** Both parties must willingly agree to the marriage.
2. **Age Requirement:** The legal age for marriage is **16 for females** and **18 for males** under Pakistani law.
3. **Witnesses:** At least two Muslim male witnesses must be present.
4. **Mehr (Dower):** A mandatory gift from the husband to the wife, specified in the **Nikah Nama**.
5. **Registration:** Marriage must be registered with the local **Union Council**.

### Case Example

In _Asma Bibi v. State (PLD 2020 SC 105)_, the Supreme Court ruled that marriage without free consent is void and constitutes coercion under Islamic and Pakistani law.

## 2. Rights and Responsibilities in Marriage

### Husband’s Responsibilities

- Provide **financial support** (Nafaqah) to the wife.
- Ensure **respect and fair treatment**.
- Maintain the household and children.

### Wife’s Rights

- **Right to Mehr** as agreed in the Nikah Nama.
- **Right to Maintenance** (food, clothing, shelter, and medical care).
- **Right to Khula** (divorce initiated by the wife).
- **Right to Work and Education**, unless restricted by contract.

### Case Example

In _Mst. Rubina v. Muhammad Anwar (PLD 2019 Lahore 114)_, the court ruled in favor of a wife seeking maintenance after the husband failed to provide financial support.

## 3. Divorce Laws in Pakistan

Divorce in Pakistan can be initiated by the husband (Talaq) or the wife (Khula), and legal procedures must be followed to ensure its validity.

### Types of Divorce

#### **1. Talaq (By Husband)**

- A husband can divorce his wife by pronouncing **Talaq** (divorce) three times.
- He must send a written notice to the **Union Council**.
- A **90-day reconciliation period** follows before finalization.

### Case Example

In _Shahida Parveen v. Muhammad Imran (PLD 2017 SC 315)_, the Supreme Court held that an oral Talaq without official notification is invalid.

#### **2. Khula (By Wife)**

- A wife can seek **Khula** through the **Family Court**.
- She must prove that the marriage is irreconcilable.
- The court may order the return of **Mehr** if required.

### Case Example

In _Saima v. Faisal (PLD 2018 Lahore 211)_, the court granted **Khula** to the wife due to physical abuse and non-maintenance.

#### **3. Mubarat (Mutual Divorce)**

- Both spouses can agree to end the marriage amicably.
- They sign an agreement and notify the **Union Council**.

## 4. Child Custody and Maintenance After Divorce

### **Custody of Children (Hizanat)**

- **Mother** has the primary right to custody until the child reaches a certain age (**7 years for boys, puberty for girls**).
- **Father** remains responsible for financial support.
- The **Guardian and Wards Act, 1890** applies to custody disputes.

### Case Example

In _Muhammad Iqbal v. Mst. Nazia (PLD 2016 SC 201)_, the Supreme Court ruled that the child's best interest takes precedence over parental rights in custody cases.

### **Maintenance of Children**

- Fathers must provide financial support, regardless of custody.
- The court determines the amount based on the father’s income.

### Case Example

In _Shabana v. Javed (PLD 2019 SC 234)_, the court ordered a father to pay adequate maintenance, ensuring the child's well-being.

## 5. Protection of Women and Legal Remedies

- Women facing abuse can seek protection under the **Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2010** and **Domestic Violence Acts**.
- Courts can impose **restraining orders** and award compensation.

### Legal Remedies

- **File for Maintenance:** If a husband refuses financial support.
- **Seek Custody Orders:** Through the Family Court.
- **Protection Orders:** In case of domestic violence.

## Conclusion

Marriage and divorce laws in Pakistan ensure protection for both spouses while emphasizing Islamic principles of justice. Legal processes, when followed correctly, safeguard the rights of men, women, and children, minimizing conflicts and ensuring fair settlements.
